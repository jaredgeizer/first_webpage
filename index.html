            Neither Brian nor Jason was prepared for the overwhelming positive response their website would receive.
Jason and Brian started their original website during their first year of graduate school in September of 2010. As teachers and mentors, they found that students and young designers were full of questions whose answers were often simple and intuitive but difficult to arrive at under self-imposed pressure. The help they needed fell somewhere between technical assistance and a kick in the rear. Sometimes we all just need to be told, “You know this. Rely on your training. Listen to your gut.” Inexperience, creative blocks, and minor setbacks are not always overcome by looking outward and asking questions; they’re overcome by trusting ourselves and taking risks. The GFDA website was a way to offer concise, poignant advice derived from fundamental design principles in a way that was highly accessible and fun. Using the F-word was rebellious, funny, and driving in its honesty. It was a perfect combination. The message coming across was that freedom from doubt and insecurity is found in working very hard and never taking oneself too seriously.In a very short time, the number of hits to the site was growing geometrically. Clearly, the advice was something people needed and wanted to hear, and visitors began voicing a strong desire for more. GFDA was suddenly plunged headfirst into the t-shirt and poster business. Its founders were dividing their time between earning their degrees, teaching courses, maintaining their website, and staying up all night prepping merchandise. It was soon apparent that their little website was going to become a business and that the time had come to take things more seriously. Within a few months, the two young entrepreneurs had converted a portion of the basement of their house into a shipping center, and, for the first time, there was tangible evidence that their lives and roles as communication designers were going to be much more exciting than they had previously imagined.The company has grown and is still growing rapidly, and the guys have found themselves seeking the help of people who don’t just provide services like printing and vending. They want collaborators. From the beginning, GFDA has generated an esprit de corps that is nothing short of infectious. People can get swept up by this energy inexplicably. This phenomenon has had profound effects on how GFDA operates internally. Photographers, developers, and designers from across the globe have found themselves contributing to the website and products. Interns don’t just tape up boxes and wrangle social media; they direct and produce much of the creative content that customers and fans fall in love with. Any friends, colleagues, or family members who have a contribution to make will find themselves eagerly encouraged to step in and help. Organizations and universities all over the country have invited Brian and Jason to tell their story; those engagements are just another way for them to share their passion. The enthusiasm with which GFDA has been cultivated has come to represent a spirit of liberation to people who dream big. That’s something worth celebrating.It takes a lot of love to keep GFDA alive and well, and that love is always being reciprocated. The idea of GFDA was born from the desire to inform and motivate, but it has matured into an experience with a measurable, positive impact on people’s lives. This impact, not fiscal growth or swelling popularity, is the mark by which Jason and Brian have measured the success of their company. So many people have reached out to thank them for their work that a new light has been cast on their mission. GFDA is now speaking to a broad audience, inspiring them to set, accomplish, and exceed personal goals. Learning to serve others with their message in this way has given Jason and Brian a new perspective on their own lives and careers. That’s why GFDA embodies a story of independence. What started as a passion project has turned into a means by which two designers have found the freedom to chart their own course in life, blazing a trail for anyone who dares to follow.
